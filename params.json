We usually start with those whose taste we feel we share and we deduce that we will like too. This is the basic intuition behind k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. Although this is perhaps one of the simplest machine learning algorithms, it is still used widely.  \r\n\r\n### Detailed Design\r\nLets check how we can implement this algorithm using R.\r\nFirst we will read the data and visualize using scatter plot.\r\n```\r\n   library(ggplot2)\r\n   knn.df <- read.csv(\"dummy_data.csv\")\r\n   head(knn.df)\r\n   knn.df$Y <- factor(knn.df$Y)\r\n   ggplot(knn.df, aes(x=X1, y=X2, shape=Y, color=Y)) +\r\n     geom_point()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![knn-scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trisha87/kNN-algo/gh-pages/images/knn-scatterplot.png)\r\n\r\nNow we want to classify whether a new data(X1 and X2 given) will be assigned to 0 or 1 for Y. For this, we have to calculate the distance vector for this test data.\r\n```\r\ndist.vectr <- fuction(knn.df, testdata)\r\n{\r\n  dist <- vector(, nrow(knn.df))\r\n  for(i in 1:nrow(knn.df))\r\n  {\r\n    dist[i] <- sqrt((knn.df[i, 'X1'] - testdata[1])^2 + (knn.df[i, 'X2'] - testdata[2])^2)\r\n  }\r\n  return(dist)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOnce we have distance vector ready, we will require another function which will return the nearest data point. First we will sort the distance vector and get the first k nearest entries\r\n```\r\nknn.points <- function(knn.df, k=5)\r\n{\r\n  dist <- dist.vectr(knn.df, testdata)\r\n  indices <- order(dist)[1:k]\r\n  predicted.y <- ifelse(mean(knn.df[indices, 'Y']) > 0.5, 1, 0)\r\n  return(predicted.y)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using R Package\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
